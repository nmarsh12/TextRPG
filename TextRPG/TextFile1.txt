check console window size with WindowWidth() and WindowHeight()
split console between a constant hud part and a changing game screen 
some kind of low framerate constant gameloop, test with different framerates


timer logic:
loop every 1/framerate seconds
do this by comparing current time to time of last check or use timers

if currentTime > lastTime + deltaTime:
	do one game loop

all moving parts should use deltatime to stay independent of framerate

input logic:
create list of inputs which call a function and get removed from list every frame
use read() if it has held input support
